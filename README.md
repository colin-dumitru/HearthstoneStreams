Hearthstone Streams
=========

This extension displays currently active streams in a simple popup to always be one click away from your favorite Hearthstone streamers. Currently, only Twitch streams are supported, but more are planned to follow.

** Update ** 

Notifications have now been added. You can visit a particular channel page, click the "Notify Me" button, and next time the stream goes online you will get a desktop notification with a link to the stream.

This extension is completely open source! You can contribite here: https://github.com/colin-dumitru/HearthstoneStreams
